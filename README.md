# Clinic Management System

The Clinic Management System is a web-based application developed to simplify communication between the doctor and the receptionist.

## How does the application operate?

The application will be operated by two admins, the doctor and the receptionist and the process will look as follows:
* Receptionist will assign token numbers to visiting patient and save it on the database along with their details. 
* Patient information will be passed on to the doctor. 
* The doctor can then view patient details and do the check-up accordingly. 
* The doctor then inputs the recommended medicines in the database which are then passed onto the receptionist.
* After receiving the medicine details, the receptionist can generate the bill and store it on the database.
